## About the Project
This project was to make some models in Scala so we could predict, with some input, specific values. We used a dataset of roughly 98 GB worth of yellow taxi trip data in the city of New York over 5 years. With that data we created some statistics about the dataset, but more importantly we created and trained 3 models to predict some aspect of the tip. For example, we created and trained a model, that based on the day of the week, the time of the day and the destination, could predict the profit the taxi driver will have (including tips).
